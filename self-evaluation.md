# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
  ## On a scale of 1 to 5, I feel my my understanding and fluency with the 'each' method is about at a 4, and I would like more practice and reps to get it to a 5.
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
  ## I felt it wasn't as hard to learn because Mike really did a great job of setting up the lesson with background context and providing us with a email distro example that made it click together, then let me productively struggle on the practice questions by giving us all the time we need to answer each and explain our thought process to one another.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
  ## I feel like I would like more practice for the sake of practice and reps, so I will make time during this holiday weekend before class 5.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
  ## When it comes to iterations I don't have questions, but rather wanting to get better at knowing methods.
